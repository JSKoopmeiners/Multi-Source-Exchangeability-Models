# Multi-Source-Exchangeability-Models

This repository contains the code used to completion the simulation study and data illustration in a manuscript entitled "Dynamic Multi-Resolution Smoothing Using Multi-Source Exchangeability Models" by Kaizer, Koopmeiners and Hobbs. Briefly, multi-source exchangeability models (MEMs) are a flexible Bayesian approach for incorporating supplementary data into the analysis of a primary data source. The following files are included:

MEM_Functions.R: A set of cuntions for implementing MEMs and used for the simulation study and illustration

MEM_Simulations.R: R file to run the simulations discussed in the manuscript for evluating the performance of MEMs

Simulation Results: This is a sub-folder that contains the simulation output from MEM_Simulations.R and used to create the tables and figures in the manuscript.

Figure3_and_SupplementaryFigures_code.R: Code to create Figure 3 in the manuscript and the Figures in the supplementary materials

Figure4_and_MiscellaneousSummaries_code.R: Code to create Figure 4 and miscellaneous summaries reported in the manuscript

Table1_CENICp1Example_code.R: Code for completing real-data example reported in manuscript. Note - the raw data for CENICp1 are not publicaly available but only the sample mean and standard deviation are required to complete the analysis and they are provided in this file
